#if we assign a name to a set of data it is known as variable

#Syntax: var=data

x=10
y=Hello

#Access a variable
#Syntax: $var or ${var}

echo x - $x
echo x - ${x}


# Variables are used to avoid repetition. Meaning if we have some data that needs to be used in many places in a the script, we declare that as a variable
# then will access that variable. Any situation the data needs to be changed, we change in one place, it changes in all places (where it appears).

# Naming Convention for variables
# Alphabets, a-z, A-Z, numbers, underscore

#Variable Types
#Shell does not have any variable type by default
# Every variable is a string. Not in, long characters, booleans

#Input Variables
